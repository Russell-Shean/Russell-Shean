# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- If you're a potential employer who wants to see examples of code I've written, I've made a special <a href="https://github.com/Russell-Shean/Code-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md">repository</a> just for you!
- Here are links to a shiny data visualization <a href="https://russ-tmu.shinyapps.io/twitter_shiny/">webapp</a> showing tweets associated with a neuroscience conference that I've made and an Rmarkdown file that shows a <a href="https://tulipsfortaiwan.github.io/Covid_528_map.html" >map</a> of COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. 
- If you have an interesting project you'd like to collaborate on, (or a job offer :smile:), feel free to look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-shean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin profile</a> or send me an email: russshean@gmail.com.



#### Here's something I made in R: 
<img src="https://github.com/Russell-Shean/Covid_SHINY_MAP/raw/main/Graphs%20and%20GIFS/quanguo_prev.gif" width="400" height="auto" /><img src="https://github.com/Russell-Shean/Covid_SHINY_MAP/raw/main/Graphs%20and%20GIFS/beibu_inc.gif" width="400" height="auto" />

1. Cumulative cases per 100,000 for Taiwan
2. New cases per 100,000 for Northern Taiwan

There's more fun stuff in my <a href="https://github.com/Russell-Shean/Code-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md">code portfolio<a />
