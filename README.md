# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- If you're a potential employer who wants to see examples of code I've written, I've made a special <a href="https://github.com/Russell-Shean/Code-Portfolio">repository</a> just for you!
- Here are links to a shiny data visualization <a href="https://russ-tmu.shinyapps.io/twitter_shiny/">webapp</a> showing tweets associated with a neuroscience conference that I've made and an Rmarkdown file that shows a <a href="" >map</a> of COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. 
- If you have an interesting project you'd like to collaborate on, (or job offer hahah), feel free to look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-shean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin profile</a> or send me an email: russshean@gmail.com.

#### Things I've made:
