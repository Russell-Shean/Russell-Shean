# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- If you're a potential employer who wants to see examples of code I've written, I've made a special repository just for you!
- Here are links to a shiny data visualization webapp that I've made and a Rmarkdown data visualization file. 
- If you have an interesting project you'd like to collaborate on, (or job offer hahah), feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/russell-shean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out</a>.

#### Things I've made:
