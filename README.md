### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- I'm working on a better system, but for now, I put a lot of my code here too: https://github.com/TulipsforTaiwan
- Feel free to contact me with questions, suggestions or collaboration ideas
- Right now I'm making maps and visualizations of Taiwan's Covid outbreak, but I'm open to other ideas too!
