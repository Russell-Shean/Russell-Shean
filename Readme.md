This is my personal account. It's a mix of finished project that could be put in a portfolio and a bunch of half-finished ideas. Here are some of the more finished projects:

1. <a href="https://github.com/Russell-Shean/batch_scripts">Batch Scripts</a> to set up an R environment:

   Reproducible doesn't mean just the code, it has to include the software and environment used to run the software. This is a windows shell script to help your coworkers and/or boss install and setup R for the first time so they can run the cool code you wrote! No more "but I don't have R installed on my computer" excuses!
3. <a href="https://github.com/Russell-Shean/bigfoot_sightings">Bigfoot Sightings</a> Shiny:

Here's an example of a Shiny project I've made. It's currently under construction while I make a bigger, better, badder 2.0 version, but I've still included 1.0 in this list because it shows a bunch of cool CSS and JS tricks that can be employed to make a shiny shinier.
